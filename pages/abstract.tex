\gls{vr} technology can benefit architectural design by providing an immersive and intuitive medium for collaboration, review and evaluation of the developed concepts. However, this immersiveness in combination with the inherently limited perceptual information available in \glspl{ve} creates a bizzare situation, where on one hand, the visual information is very convincing, but on the other, the familiar perceptual feedbacks from the environment and our own actions are stripped away.
Having started with a question of how this situation affects the satisfaction with collaboration experience, I arrive at the concept of \gls{wa}. I build upon the design of a previous study on the \gls{wa} from the field of \gls{cscw}, adapt it into a study of architectural collaboration in an immersive gls{vr} environment. 
The results of the conducted experiments support previous research and show the high benefit of using additional auditory feedback for supporting workspace awareness.
