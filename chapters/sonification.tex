\chapter{Sonification}
%(really small chapter, explaining the possible ways to implement auditory cues [auditory icons, earcons, …])

% TODO: also cite Gutwin 2002: the pre-research and the findings (the limitations of audio awareness, and "How and why does audio improve awareness?")
% TODO: maybe cite Gutwin 2011, too. THere was something on sound being a good tool or wharevs

In this chapter I will review sonification and look into the different tools it provides us with, which can be used for creating auditory awareness presentations. I will call the sounds emitted by elements in a workspace - auditory cues. Sonification is a concept akin to visualization. Both can be applied to a dataset, and while the visualization will do it in form of images (possibly interactive), sonification will use "non-speech audio to convey or perceptualize data" [from Sonification wiki: Kramer, Gregory, ed. (1994). Auditory Display: Sonification, Audification, and Auditory Interfaces. -- couldn't verify the source].

\section{Sound Properties}
% I mention timbre in Experiments chapter
% + harmonics & halftones (and how they allow to differentiate between sounds), fundamental frequency
% Occlusion is audio SDKs

% HRTFs and stuff? Can tie the stereo headphones here as a exapmle of why they suck.
