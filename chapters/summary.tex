% the fact that we only sample the level 1 SA/WA (we won't be going into sampling direction of translation guesses from the participants)
% could also try to describe it according to WA framework
% frame drop
\textit{Frame rate} The implementation of the voxel drawing system was not aimed at maximizing performance, as the result the frame rate dropped to around 70 FPS, when completing some of the shapes (i.e. the Low Poly Trees). One participants indicated that they felt a little bit dizzy due to this problem at one point.

\textit{Minimap} Some users indicated that the minimap implementation was not the most convenient, especially in the \textit{Minimap Only}, where to monitor the map they had to take their attention of the main task. While this will most likely be the case in any implementation, a possible solution would be to see the effects of having the minimap attached to the users head in a non-obstructive way.

\textit{Controls} Some users indicated that the controller mappings chosen for the final study were not convenient (Appendix \ref{app:finalstudy_controls}). Specifically, the fact that the main function of the 3D brush controller was mapped to the trigger, but for the minimap controller - to the touchpad. The controls were chosen this way, because drawing with your thumb constantly on the touchpad did not seem so convenient, however, the laser pointer's capabilities map perfectly to the two input affordances for the touchpad, the touch and press, while the pressure sensitivity of the trigger does not provide such a clear separation between the press levels. This ambiguity of choice indicates that physical ergonomics factors should also play a role, when implementing the actual system for collaboration in immersive \gls{vr}.

% TODO: Support the Gutwin findings; his participants also found both awareness displays to be the most useful setup; Also, address this in abstract, too.
