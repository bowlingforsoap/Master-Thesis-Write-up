In Introduction I will write about the main motivation for this work, which is extending the CDP with a collaborative immersive virtual reality component, and the main problems that come along with it, specifically, user awareness of each other's actions. Then I would state my initial hypothesis about the additional cues being able to make the experience more "comfortable".

The Literature Review section of the thesis will investigate human information processing and mention that auditory cues are a great and underused tool, which could be used for signaling, monitoring, and so on [1]. Then I turn to the Situation Awareness (SA) in VR, and how it is a measure of a user being able to perceive, interpret, and project the things happening within the environment [2]. I will then state that situation awareness is has subfield called Workspace Awareness (WA), which deals exactly with the awareness users have of each other in groupware systems [3,4]. We will see that WA deals mainly with monitoring and secondary tasks, and how "comfortable experience" can be described in terms of WA framework. Last part of Literature Review section turns to the field of sonification to explore how it can help with monitoring activities, and the different types and properties of sound that could be unitized [5].

Concept/Discussion. Here I will state the purpose of the project and explain how I am going to solve the problem of WA in the collaborative architectural environment. I will classify the system according to WA framework, and then state that we want to answer the what and where WA questions with auditory cues and (possibly visual cues in the form of a radar view). I will mention the research by Gutwin (2011) and say that I will try to adapt it to our use case. Then I will describe what is needed to do it (what we need to study, experiment with, etc.) and what is needed to get the answers to my research question - whether the additional auditory (and visual cues) help with WA.

Experiments. This section will one by one introduce the experiments made in this research: introduction (with statement of purpose), assumptions (limitations), apparatus and process, results and discussion. Here we will have all pilots in 1 subsection, and all the proper experiments (sound spatial judgement and, possibly, WA study) will have their own subsection.

In the Conclusions section I will aggregate the all findings and prior discussion to try and give an answer to the research question. I will mention the limitations of the conducted study. This section will end with a look into the future work.

In Summary I will go over the whole work step by step, recall what has been done, mention the results of the experiments
