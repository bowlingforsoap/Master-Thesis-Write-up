\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}
\section{Motivation: Teamwork is important. Creative thinking implies generation of ideas, collaboration, and communication. Virtual Reality (VR) is a great enhancement for creative thinking tool-set in architecture.}

\section{Problem Description: A lot of different unexpected things can happen during a VR collaboration experience. Users must have better situational awareness, so that the system doesn't hinder their performance (here might be Gerchards quote)}

\section{Hypothesis: Situational awareness can be increase by taking advantage of multisensory processing.}


\chapter{Literature Review}
\section{Creative Thinking in Architecture: Explore what actions/interactions architects perform during this process} % Maybe General to Specific would be my repetetive structure?
Process Analysis: The main goal of Creative Thinking in Architecture. Tasks that can be solved utilizing the creative thinking process. The steps used in the creative thinking process. Common actions/interactions for different tasks at each step.

\section{Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Evaluation: Research in what way are the new HCI systems are validated/evaluated}
\subsection{HCI: The goals of the HCI field. Different sub-domains of HCI (psychology, computer science). Examples of specific types of interactions HCI deals with: VR, AR, etc.}
\subsection{Solution validation/evaluation in HCI: methods, and principles.}

\section{Collaborative Virtual Environments: Find out what we are going to start building our implementation upon}
\subsection{Virtual Reality status quo: Virtual Reality development (and state-of-art). Advantages and Limitations.  Design obligations when developing VR applications. }
\subsection{Interactions in Virtual Environments}
\subsection{Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs): status quo, Development of CVEs from Churchill (1998) to Greenwald (2017). CVE design considerations (HCI aspect) and the state of art.}
\subsection{Implementation approaches: Networking and VR (Maybe, more appropriate in Design and Implementation)}
a. Networking: Overview of the ways to connect apps for real-time, low latencey communication
b. VR: Overview and comparison of existing platforms for creating VR experiences


\begin{comment}
Methodology: approach to solving the problem; chosen HCI methodology for the final evaluation - no idea
a. Chosen HCI evaluation methodology

\section{Evaluation HCI Methodology: The way we are going to collect data and analyze the results.}


\chapter{Design and Implementation: How are we going to do it/What was done}
\section{Networking: Approach to establish real-time, low-latency communication between two VR headsets; framework for transferring actions over the network}

\section{Interactions: Design and implementation of machine-agnostic interactions, which are broadcasted to users (local and remote) for processing}

\section{Show how the previous two points come together}
