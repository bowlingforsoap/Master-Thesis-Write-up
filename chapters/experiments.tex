\chapter{Experiments}

In total, 5 experiments were conducted for this thesis. Two were quick prototypes to validate the initial speculation, two - preparatory pilot studies to determine values for some properties of the final experiment and test the process of sampling participants for \gls{wa} index, and one formal study to test \nameref{final_study}.

\section{Prototypes}
Initial motivation for this work was a question of whether sudden manipulations of buildings in \gls{vr} would cause uncomfortable experience for users (Fig. \ref{fig:a1unawareofa2actions}). Two prototypes were developed to test this speculation: Buildings Popping Up and Moving Buildings.

\paragraph{Buildigns Popping Up} 
\label{buildingspoppingup}
The first prototype looked into how would the participants' experience would be influenced by a building suddenly appearing before them, when they were concerned with their own task.
% Participants
3 participants (all male) were chosen for this experiment among the members of the \gls{hci} group at the University of Otago. Two had prior experience in \gls{vr}, one had not.
% Procedure & Task
Participants were placed in the immersive \gls{vr} environment: a 3D model of the campus of the University of Otago. This was not a collaborative task, the participants were in the \gls{ve} alone. They were introduced to the affordances of the environment: teleportation, walking and looking around. Next, participants were asked to navigate to the university clock tower. While they were performing the navigation task, a building would pop up in-front of them a couple of times at pseudo-random times (decided and initiated by the experimenter). After the completion of the experiment the participants were asked to describe the experience, especially parts, where a building appeared in-front of them.
% Apparatus (i.e Unity, Resonance Audio, stereo headphones, Vive)
Unity3d and Oculus Rift \gls{hmd} with Touch Motion controllers were used in this experiment.
% Results
The participant with no prior experience in \gls{vr} described the experience as unexpected, but was also not sure, whether he caused it, which could be attributed to the absence of the prior experience with the \gls{vr} technology. The other two participants indicated that they were a bit stuttered by the experience, but in general, "didn't care much for it".

\paragraph{Moving Buildings}
Due to the results of the first experiment, the problem was regarded as worth of further exploration. For the second prototype the decision was made to come a bit closer to the initial motivation: moving buildings.
% Participants
4 new participant (all male) were chosen among the members of \gls{hci} group at the University of Otago, none took part in the previous experiment. Three had moderate experience with \gls{vr}, one had little.
% Procedure & Task
The environment affordances and the introduction remained the same. The task was extended, so that when participants find the clock tower, they were asked to assume their place at the viewing spot prepared for them (Fig. \ref{fig:prototype2viewvingspot}). At this point the participants were asked to observe the clock tower and tell the experimenter if anything seemed odd about it. Some elements of the tower were off axis (Fig. \ref{fig:prototype2clocktoweroddfeatures}), and this task was meant to lull participants' vigilance. As soon as participants started looking for any odd features, the movement of the clock tower towards the used with the speed of 200 units (meters) per second was initiated by the experimented. The approximate distance to from the viewing spot to the tower was 69 meters, the clock tower would stop 0.5 meters in-front of a participant. At this point the experiment would finish, and the participants would be asked about their experience.

\section{Pilot Studies}
In preparation to the \nameref{final_study} study, two pilot studies were conducted: \nameref{study_one}, and \nameref{study_two}. This was done to study certain aspects of the final study separately, and make decisions, such as what sound type (earcons or auditory icons) to choose, and at what speed to translate the buildings.

\section{Workspace Awareness in Immersive Virtual Reality}
\label{final_study}
% Goal of the study
The goal of this study was to analyze \gls{wa} that participants have of others present in the same immersive \gls{vr} environment. Participants were presented with a primary and secondary tasks. Primary task was tracing 3D models with a 3D brush, and secondary task was a \gls{wa} task - reporting changes to the environment.

\paragraph{Methods}
Aspects of \gls{wa} that were evaluated was participantsâ€™ reaction speed when provided with different types of awareness presentation (audio and/or visual cues from the environment).

% Participants
12 participants (8 men and 4 women) were recruited among friends, employees from the chair, and students from the \gls{tum}; ages ranged from 22 to 32 (mean 25.2, std. 2.5). Only one participant reported having "partially" good hearing, others reported good hearing. 3 people reported to be familiar with \gls{vr} technology, among them, one person reported being a proficient gamer and one - having partaken in driving simulator studies. Participants were a mix of gamers, non-gamers, and casual gamers. Participants were also equally distributed among people who had experience with \gls{vr}, those who had some experience, and those who had no prior experience. Two reported being online gamers, and another two - occasional online gamers. Only one person had prior experience with architecture, and had worked in the field. One participant tried 3D drawing in the system, but otherwise none of the participants had seen the system before, or took part in the trial studies.

% Procedure
Participants were given a written and verbal introduction to the experiment,
after which were asked to sign the consent form for using their data.
Next, participants went through the tutorial, where the 3D brush, laser pointer for pinpointing the buildings and auditory cues were introduced. Participants went through a small scenario resembling the actual experiment, where they were asked to trace a pillar, while catching a moving building, and keeping track of how the building sounds and where it is visually.
During the actual experiment, each participant was tested in each of the 3 test groups.
At the end of the experiment, participants were asked to fill in a self-report questionnaire.
Participants did not rest between the different conditions. 

% Task
Participants were tasked with the scenario, in which there are 2 architects (A1 and A2), who perform their separate tasks in the same urban district (\ref{fig:urbandistrict}) in \gls{vr}. A1 (participant) has 2 tasks: primary and secondary. The primary task is to trace given 3D shapes with a 3D brush (a tracked 6-\gls{dof} controller). Meanwhile, A2 (simulated ivisible user) can translate any building in the district to any other part of the district at any time. The secondary (workspace awareness) task of A1 is to keep track of changes to the environment and pinpoint them with a virtual laser pointer (another tracked 6-\gls{dof} controller).

\end{figure}


% Apparatus: Unity, Resonance Audio, stereo headphones, Vive
Experiment was implemented with the help of Unity3d, version  2018.1.5f1 and Resonance Audio SDK for Unity, version 1.2.1 with sound occlusion turned off. For the hardware, \gls{vr} headset and controllers from the HTC Vive were used, along with on-ear stereo headphones, and a Windows 10 PC (TODO: specs).

% Study Factors and Conditions: what my factors are, conditions == independent variables' values
\textit{Experimental Design} 
The study examined one independent variable: type of awareness presentation. 3 controlled awareness presentations  were made available to the participants: a minimap of the district (\ref{fig:minimap_controller}), auditory cues emitted by translating buildings in the scene (sound of concrete sliding on concrete), and their combination. Awareness presentations were rotated for each participant, so that each presentation was seen in the same position equal number of times. 
Each awareness presentation was tested for 10 minutes, during which exactly 8 buildings were chosen and translated randomly. There were 24 data points measured per user in each session. Data collected were the reaction speed in determining the position of a moving \gls{vb}, along with 3D drawings created by participants.

\paragraph{Gutwin vs our study}
% TODO: add a pic: Gutwin's (vertical) and our (horizontal) working (sound) plane
Since, this study extends upon \cite{gutwin_chalk_2011}, in this paragraph I provide a comparison of the two.
The main difference between - workspace is no longer a 2D plane, but an immersive 3D \gls{vr} environment. An important change here is the fact that participants are able to look around at the workspace, and notice some changes to the environment, even without the help of the minimap or auditory cues.
Second distinction is in the primary task of the participant and the simulated agent. In \cite{gutwin_chalk_2011} the participant performs the same task, as an agent: drawing with chalk. Additionally, the participant's actions emit the same sound (even though, at a lower volume) as the drawings of the agent. In this study, the primary task of the participant is - 3D drawing with voxels. This activity doesn't emit any sound. It is also different from the agent's task - translation of buildings in the urban district. Nevertheless, the tasks are still contextually related with regards to the architectural activity in urban environment.
\cite{gutwin_chalk_2011} do not specify the audio plane, in which the sound was simulated, in this experiment, the place was horizontal (TODO: ref figure).
