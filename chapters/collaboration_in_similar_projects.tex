\chapter{Collaboration in Similar Projects}

% Intro: Introduce what this whole chapter is about

This chapter is going describe the ?status quo of the Collaborative Virtual Environments, highlight the state of art, and the experiment on the Workspace Awareness that the practical part of this thesis took as the base.

\section{Status quo}
.. Like theory part
Define CVE, Groupware, and cooperation levels

\section{Related projects}
Mention some projects that are related, but won't be discussed in the detail in this work. The purpose of this subsection is to provide an overview of the current state of the groupware/collaborative software systems.
Lena
® Provides a good overview of the Collaboration and interaction in similar projects
® Focuses more on interactions …
Greenspace II
® A related work from the architectural filed
® Morally aged, Greenwald uses some findings from it
[some other works]

\section{State of art: Multi-User Framework for Collaboration and Co-Creation in Virtual Reality}
§ In this section I will discuss the work I found, which serves as the state of art for current development of Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) - Multi-User Framework for Collaboration and Co-Creation in Virtual Reality (Greenwald et al. 2017).
Goals
Setup/system
Focus and the results
